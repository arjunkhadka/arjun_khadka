a) Sample mean = 92.33333
Mean value represents the point average of the sample


One Sample t-test shows the following results

data:  score
t = 46.457, df = 29, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 88.26842 96.39825
sample estimates:
mean of x 
 92.33333 

b) Yes the sample is likly to represent the polulation paramenter as the p-value of the t-test is less than 2.2e-16

c) the computed standard error is 3.282263

d) the value in part 3 measures the standard deviation of means of all possible samples.

e) 95% confidence interval is : 88.26842 96.39825
   Mean +- 1.96 * Standard Error

f) Confidence interval represents the means values for the lower and upper limits for the 95% of the times the sample is drawn from the population
